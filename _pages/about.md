If i want to say something about me straightly, I am a simple guy love to play with computer security. I started self studying in 2010 when Backtrack Linux 3 or 4 Released and corelanc0der was sharing his awesome buffer overflow tutorials in [corelan](https://corelan.be). Recently, i started playing in [HTB](https://hackthebox.eu) and in one month ranked as **Pro Hacker**.

I am not so good in programming language but still have basic knowledge in Bash scripting, Python, PHP and ASM. I have tried to learn all of these just play better break the security ethically.

In the past, i had a hard time paying fee for any kind of certification, So my university was my self-study. At this moment i am planning to try OSCP. 

**Why This Website?**
    Github really is a good place to store information. This is nothing more than keeping and sharing my note so that i can suggest and improve myself. For easy access to my notes i created github account setup this domain.

**What Would I like to do in the future?**
    I would like to help others and learn more and more. If possible i would like work as a freelance penetration tester!
