# About Me

Frankly, I just enjoy doing penetration testing. My penetration testing journey started in back 2010 with backtrack linux and by corelan buffer overflow tutorials. As i was doing self-study, i have read several books(including many programing books too) and most loved book was: 

1. Hacking Exposed Books
2. The Art of Exploitation
3. The grey hat hacker hand book
4. The Web Application hacker hand book

After that i had break for a long time for some personal reason. But I can't live without exploring and trying hacking techniques and expand my skills. It's awesome, it's fun!

I started again, and decide to stay with it forever. I see some good udemy course about penetration testing. Just to see if something is new, i quickly enrolled and watched, such as:
1. [Practical Ethical Hacking](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/) 
2. [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation/)
3. [Learn Python and Ethical Hacking](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/)

**I just quickly tried to update my existing knowledge** 

## Hack The Box(HTB) is awesome! 
Only reading and watching interesting books or video is not enough. I always feel to attack the system ethically and legally only. I test and try to hack [HTB Box](https://hackthebox.eu). My current rank in HTB is **Pro Hacker**. Currently, i am doing some retired machine as i decided to try OSCP exam very soon!

## How to Contact Me
Most of the time i am active in HTB discord channel. The channel is really active and all guys are very friendly. You can find me there, on twitter or even sending an email!


...**Happy Legal Hacking**...
